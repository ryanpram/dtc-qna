For somebody who will be reviewing your project, it will be new information. So just give them some context and explain, “I used GridSearchCV because this is easier and this is what you can do.” Then you describe it, and you give your peers a chance to learn from what you’re doing. This way, they will not be lost and will be able to grade your homework. If you do that, you can use whatever you want.\\xa0\\nFrom the materials in the course, like if you use logistic regression, or rich regression, or XGBoost, or random forest, then you don't need to really go into details when documenting because I would expect that people understand that without much explanation. Maybe it's also a good idea if somebody, let's say, wants to use not XGBoost, but LightGBM, or CatBoost, which are different implementations of gradient boosting – you're free to use them in your project as well. You can use FastAPI instead of Flask, for example. You can use Poetry instead of Pipenv. You can use Conda instead of Pipenv. You're basically free to explore to use what you want and play with different tools, just be sure to document that.\""
